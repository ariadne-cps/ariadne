### 2.3

*Date:  /  /2021*

- [#538](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/538) (N) Introduce a concurrency module designed for parallel execution of internal tasks
- [#549](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/549) (N) Introduce a Least Recently Used cache utility for holding a limited number of homogeneous objects 
- [#551](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/551) (C) Make VectorFieldEvolver process sets in parallel (when splitting initially or during evolution)
- [#552](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/552) (C) Remove evolve/reach/reach_evolve methods from EvolverInterface, relying on orbit generation only
- [#553](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/553) (C) Remove ability to write an evolver object to the standard output, since it was implemented as a fixed string for all evolvers anyway
- [#556](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/556) (C) Disallow unsafe default value of upper semantics for orbit methods
- [#558](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/558) (C) Remove unnecessary IteratedMapEvolver::enclosure methods 
- [#563](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/563) (C) Rename the 'output' module into the 'io' module to support future classes related to input
- [#539](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/539) (F) A segmentation fault sometimes would be issued when terminating the executable, due to logging
- [#557](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/557) (F) Fix behavior of StopWatch utility for concurrent code, enhance the class for choosing a duration type

### 2.2

*Date: 25/04/2021*

- [#441](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/441) (N) Introduce support for Gnuplot output, including animated gif plot of sets and tridimensional plots for PDEs
- [#507](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/507) (N) Introduce a simulator for vector field dynamics
- [#514](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/514) (N) Introduce Python examples in python/examples
- [#538](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/538) (N) Introduce a concurrency module with basic primitives for parallel execution
- [#509](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/509) (A) Add support for a set as input in simulators, using the midpoint as the effective point
- [#513](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/513) (A) Add missing Python bindings for verify_safety in (Hybrid)ReachabilityAnalyser
- [#516](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/516) (A) Add missing Python bindings for Real predicates to be used in automata specification
- [#518](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/518) (A) Add missing Python bindings for evolver configuration and initial set assignment
- [#520](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/520) (A) Add missing Python bindings for plotting using HybridFigure
- [#543](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/543) (A) Add missing Python bindings for iterating across ListSet of Enclosure classes
- [#527](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/527) (A) Allow to draw a Labelled/Hybrid orbit directly to a Labelled/Hybrid figure
- [#492](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/492) (C) Change SFINAE code to use C++20 concepts, currently preventing AppleClang compilation under macOS until the compiler supports Concepts
- [#529](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/529) (C) Disallow construction of VectorField and IteratedMap from a Function, since it was broken
- [#533](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/533) (C) Map<K,V> now checks for existing key using ARIADNE_ASSERT, yielding errors also for Release builds
- [#447](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/447) (F) Check that a VectorField is defined with dynamics for all involved variables, fixes a segfault within evolution
- [#532](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/532) (F) RealExpressionBoundedConstraintSet could be constructed in an incoherent way, due to missing checks
- [#536](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/536) (F) Discrete evolution did not update the enclosure time, resulting in incorrect plots vs time  
- [#211](https://github.com/ariadne-cps/ariadne/issues/211) (R) Remove various deprecated functions
