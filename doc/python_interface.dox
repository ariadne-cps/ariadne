\page python_interface_page Python Interface

The Python interface provides Python bindings to %Ariadne's C++ library.
It does not introduce new functionality; instead it merely makes the
C++ classes, methods, functions and variables usable from a Python script.

As far as possible, the Python interface mimics the C++ interface, so
the C++ documentation is also applicable for Python users. However, there
are some unavoidable differences, due to the differences between C++ and Python.
The main differences that Python users consulting the C++ documentation
should be aware of are given below:

 - <em>Not all classes and methods are exported:</em> <br>
To see which classes are exported, type:
  \code python3 -c "import ariadne; print(dir(ariadne))" \endcode
Missing classes may be
added in a future release.

 - <em>C++ templates:</em> <br>
C++ allows classes to be defined which depend on other classes;
such classes are called \em templates. For example, the template \ref Bounds "Bounds<X>"
describes bounds on a quantity, where the lower and upper bounds are objects of class \a X.
Thus Bounds<Dyadic> represents dyadic bounds on a real number,
and Bounds<FloatMP> would represents multiple-precision floating-point bounds.
Each instantiation of a C++ template yields a different class.
Since Python does not have templates, in the Python interface,
each instantiation has a single name derived from the template name and the class parameter.
For example, \ref Bounds "Bounds<Dyadic>" translates to the Python class \ref DyadicBounds "DyadicBounds".
The Python class name is available from
C++ (and can be found in the documentation) as a C++ <tt>typedef</tt> class alias.

 - <em>Conversion:</em> <br>
Conversions from a class <tt>F</tt> to a class <tt>T</tt> are defined by a constructor
<tt>T(F)</tt> in class <tt>T</tt>, or by a conversion operator <tt>operator T()</tt>
in class <tt>F</tt>. Such conversions may be automatically applied in the Python
interface when dispatching functions, though the conversion applied may differ slighly from
the C++ version. When in doubt, use an explicit constructor <tt>T(obj)</tt> to convert to
type <tt>T</tt>.

 - <em>Operators:</em> <br>
C++ logical, arithmetic and comparison operators
are declared as  <tt>operator</tt>\f$\star\f$<tt>(X1,X2)</tt>. In both C++ and Python,
the operator can be used as <tt>x1</tt> \f$\star\f$ <tt>x2</tt>. Python has its own
system for declaring operators; e.g. multiplication is defined by a class
method <tt>__mul__</tt>. <br>
Note that C++ does
not have a 'power' operator; <tt>operator^</tt> is 'bitwise exclusive or', and
has a lower precedence than multiplication. In Python, the power operator is
used by <tt>x1 ** x2</tt>.

 - <em>Printing:</em> <br>
In C++, printing is achieved by defining <tt>OutputStream& operator<<(OutputStream& os, Class obj)<tt>.
In Python, printing is performed by the <tt>print(obj)</tt> statement, or by converting to a string
using <tt>str(obj)</tt> or <tt>repr(obj)</tt>. The Python output of <tt>repr</tt> typically differs
from the C++ output or that of <tt>str</tt>, and is designed so that <tt>eval(repr(obj))</tt>
yields an object equivalent to the original argument.

 - <em>C++ extended literals:</em> <br>
The C++ <tt>operator""</tt> can be used to define extended numeric and string literals.
For example, \ref operator"" _dyadic(long long double) can be used as <tt>1.375_dyadic</tt> to
be interpreted as the Dyadic number \f$11/2^3\f$. Python does not support extended literals,
but the same result may be obtained either by a constructor, or by using the literal tag as
a function e.g. <tt>dyadic(1.375)</tt>.
