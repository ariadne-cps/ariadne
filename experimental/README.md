Experimental code is not automatically built as part of the distribution.

- The examples provide examples that are meant to go into the main examples directory and as such they refer to Ariadne internally;
- The features provide experimental new additions to the library that are not developed in their own branch; due to the ultimate goal of moving in the source directory, they also refer to Ariadne internally;
- The prototypes are isolated implementations and are built as separate CMake projects.
